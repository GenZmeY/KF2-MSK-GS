Mutator providing some functions of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/msk-gs]MSK-GS[/url] servers.

Contains implementations of my ideas and/or combinations of other mutators for compatibility.

Not intended for use with other servers and will never be made available to the public, so don't ask me how to use it.

Of course I can't forbid you to use it, but then don't be surprised that your server can break at any second due to the fact that I suddenly decided to delete or redo something in this mutator.

If you are interested in some feature from this mutator, you can subscribe to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/GenZmeY/myworkshopfiles/]me in the steam workshop[/url] and follow my work. I try to post everything I do to the public. I think someday I will be able to put everything into separate mutators and abandon this hodgepodge.
