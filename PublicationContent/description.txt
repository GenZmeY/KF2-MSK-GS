[h1]📋 Description[/h1]
Mutator providing some functions of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/msk-gs]MSK-GS[/url] servers.
Contains implementations of my ideas and/or combinations of other mutators for compatibility.

The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/msk-gs/announcements/detail/3645134002744389126]MSK-GS project is closed[/url], so it's now open source.
I am posting this in the hope that this code will be useful to someone.

[h1]❌ Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP earned will not be saved.

[h1]⚙️ Usage & Setup[/h1]
I never planned to make this mod public, so I don't have any instructions for you. You'll have to figure it out on your own. Study [url=https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-MSK-GS]the mutator code[/url], look at [url=https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-MSK-GS-Resources]my configs[/url] - I'm sure you'll succeed.

[b]If you are not ready to figure it out on your own, refrain from using this mutator.[/b]
